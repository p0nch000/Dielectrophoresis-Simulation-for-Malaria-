## Description
This project implements a MATLAB-based simulation for studying the effects of dielectrophoresis on malaria-infected cells. The user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) enables users to visualize the electric field and the movement of particles within it, providing valuable insights into the behavior of infected cells under the influence of an electric field.

## Features
- Intuitive graphical user interface.
- Electric field simulation with positive and negative charges.
- Particle animation to demonstrate dielectrophoresis.
- Adjustable parameters including rod length, number of grid points, and number of charges.

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2020a or later.

## Installation and Execution
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git`.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
3. Run the `electric_field_simulation.m` script.
4. Utilize the GUI to adjust simulation parameters and start the simulation.

## Usage
### Simulation Parameters
- **Rod Length**: Adjusts the length of the rod generating the electric field.
- **Number of Grid Points**: Determines the resolution of the grid for electric field calculations.
- **Number of Charges**: Defines the number of charges used to generate the electric field.

### Controls
- Adjust simulation parameters using sliders and input fields.
- Click "Start Simulation" to visualize the effects of the electric field.
